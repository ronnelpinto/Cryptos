the code works fine

how to go about now:

i have set everything by passing values using a http Get request and so whatever values go thru the url are critical for the working of the code

when u first login n if u hav not set the key, then click "generate key", then in in "phrases.html" , after saving in db, use the BUTTON only to go back.

now in "des", once key is set, then use "fetch key frm db button" to get the key, n then use "setkey" to set that key to encrypt and decrypt.

C THE URL WHILE DOING ALL THIS, U CAN C HOW THE VALUES R BEING PASSED


Now the stuff u have to do n give to me latest by TOMM MORNING ARE:

prevent multiple db entries handling, one user only one key, else throw error.
implementing similarly for AES
testing the login and authentication features. the validation has some flaws, it accepts even if "confirm password" is wrong in "signup"
VERY IMPORTANT:trying to pass parameters using routes feature in app.js, Something i got pissed doing, else u mus remove the tabs, as if we click the tabs then it will take the default route and we cannot pass values like userid.


Do finish quickly and forward the code back to me. The first db concsistency is very important as well as the routing issues.
